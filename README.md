# 2-dollar-dinosaurs

*Note: If we use this script, the company who runs the service we are ordering through pays for the difference in the order so restaurants are still paid fairly. We have spoken to an employee at this company who likes our cause and has given us permission to continue using this script to fund our activities.*

Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. The code is bad. The script is
bad. But it _works_. I say that tentatively.

You need to export the following before using the script:

```
export CC_NUMBER='XXXX'
export CC_TYPE='American Express'
export CC_EXP_MONTH='XX'
export CC_EXP_YEAR='XXXX'
export CC_CVV='XXXX'
export EMAIL_FRONT='EMAIL_ADDRESS'
export EMAIL_BACK='gmail.com'
```
